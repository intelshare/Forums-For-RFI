# Marketplaces
Hello everyone, I'm sharing a list of forums that initial access brokers, data brokers, and threat actors use to leak, sell, or purchase data.
Anyone interested in collaborating is asked to update the list if they come across any forums that are engaged in similar activities.
Point to note: For certain forums, I have not provided an onion link, but if you visit their clearnet website, you will find one. 
If certain onion links don't function, there's a good probability that the server is down or that the url has been modified to evade 3 letter agencies.
Regards and a shout-out to everyone in the information security community, including security researchers, hackers, APTs, and ransomware gangs.
